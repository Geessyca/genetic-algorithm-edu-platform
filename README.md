# AGofIF: An Interactive Educational Platform for Introducing Genetic Algorithm Concepts

## Project Description
AGofIF is an interactive web-based platform designed to facilitate the teaching and learning of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) through intuitive simulations and visualizations. Inspired by the challenges of teaching abstract AI concepts, the platform provides hands-on experiences for students and educators, allowing users to configure key parameters (such as mutation rates and selection methods) and observe their impact on evolutionary processes in real time. The project was evaluated in technical high school and undergraduate classes, demonstrating significant improvements in conceptual clarity and engagement. Over 94% of participants found the tool effective and intuitive for learning GAs.

## Project Structure
